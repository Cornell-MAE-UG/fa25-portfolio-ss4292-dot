For a class, we were asked to make a sketch of a specific design. The goal was to construct a lifting mechanism for a 150 cm long by 50 cm high two-dimensional workspace. Only the maximum force parameters of the linear actuator, which was picked from an online catalog, three pin supports, two of which were attached to the ground, and one rigid bar of a predetermined length (decided by the designer) were allowed to be used in the system.

 The aim was to determine the ideal frame or mechanism configuration and dimensions to optimize lifting height and load capacity. It was assumed that the supports, bar, and actuator were all completely rigid structural components. For the project to attain the maximum lifted weight at the highest possible height within the specified design space, geometric restrictions, force transmission, and mechanical efficiency have to be balanced.
