## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Sofia Savoia, and I was raised in Italy and hold both U.S. and Italian citizenship. I am a Mechanical Engineering major with a Business minor at Cornell University in the United States. Being a part of Pi Sigma Epsilon, a business fraternity at Cornell, has allowed me to master my teamwork, leadership, and professional growth abilities. I got an internship with Lamborghini because of my love for performance and innovation, which allowed me to obtain practical experience in the automotive sector. In a research paper on nuclear energy, I also looked at how technology and sustainability interact. I started Moveable Earth, a nonprofit organization that helps victims of natural disasters, outside of academia. My goal is to make significant progress by bridging engineering accuracy, commercial strategy, and global influence through all of these experiences.
